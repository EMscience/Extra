# Jupyter Supported Interactive Hydrometeorological Data Preprocessing

Hydrological Data Quality Control and Filling Missing Values

Raw hydrometeorological datasets contain errors, gaps and unrealistic values that needs preprocessing. 
The objective of this work is developing an interactive data preprocessing platform that enables 
acquiring and transforming publicly available raw hydrometeorological data to a ready to use  
dataset. This interactive platform is at the core of the Comprehensive Hydrologic Observatory SEnsor Network CHOSEN dataset (Zhang et al. 2021 submitted to HP). 
[CHOSEN](https://gitlab.com/esdl/chosen) provides a multitude of intensively measured hydrometeorological datasets (e.g., snow melt and soil moisture data besides 
the common precipitation, air temperature and streamflow measurements) across 30 watersheds in the conterminous US.

## Method

The interactive data preprocessing platform starts with acquiring a raw hydrometeorological data table and 
proceeds with three interactive computations to fill missing values, 1. Interpolation, 2. Regression and
3. Climate Caltalog
