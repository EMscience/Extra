# Jupyter Meets the Earth: Hydrological use cases

This Jupyter book presents two projects: 

1. Hydrometeorological data preprocessing
2. Hydrological model benchmarking

The first project enables interactively aquiring and preprocessing raw hydrometeorological
data to deliver a ready to use hydrometeorological data. As such, it involves different
data quality control and filling missing value techniques. The project is at the core of the
[CHOSEN](https://gitlab.com/esdl/chosen) dataset that provides intensively monitored hydrometeorological dataset for 30 
watersheds across the CONUS. 

The second project focuses on interactively benchmarking hydrological models using both 
the common statistical and the recent information theoretic based model benchmarking techniques. 
As a test case, the project focuses on benchmarking the [National Hydrological Model (NHM)](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm6B9) product of 
the USGS that covers the CONUS.
